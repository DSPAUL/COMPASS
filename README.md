# COMPASS
The Codex Organizer to make Pen-and-paper Adventuring Super Simple or COMPASS for short is a windows application to organize and manage all your TTRPG rulebooks, inspired by [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite). 

## Story
If you are an RPG fan like me, you probably have lots of pdf's both homebrew and official from sites such as [Drivethrough RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/), [Humble Bundle Books](https://www.humblebundle.com/books),  [GM Binder](https://www.gmbinder.com/), [Homebrewery](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/), [itch.io](https://itch.io/books/genre-rpg) or content from subreddits, patreon creators and kickstarters. Or perhaps you own them in digital form on sites such as [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources#Sourcebooks) or [Roll20](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/BookIndex).  Keeping track of all these books is hard and nothing is more frustrating than franticly clicking trough folders in search of that one statblock you need in the heat of combat. COMPASS solves this problem by bringing all of your books together in one place that is easily searchable, sortable and filterable. 

## Features
- **Unify** your digital tabletop RPG sourcebook library so everything is in one place. 
- **Import** any pdf or link a URL for online sources. You can also manually add books to include your physical collection. 
- **Automatic metadata** such as Author, Publisher, Release date from pdf's and supported sites that can be used to sort and filter your books. Supported sites at the moment are Homebrewery and GM Binder. 
- **Categorize** all your books using Tags. You can add Tags for anything you like, some examples:
	- The type of content like *Adventure*, *Monster Stats* or *Setting/Lore*.
	- The edition or ruleset such as *DnD 5e* or *Pathfinder 2e*.
	- The setting such as *Forgotten realms* or *Eberron*.
	- The Genre such as *Horror*, *Fantasy* or *Sci-Fi*.
	- Whatever works for you, you can create tags for everything.
- **Organize** Tags in a folder like structure to retain the advantages of folders, without the need for file duplication. 
- **Filter and Sort** all your books by *Title, Author, Publisher, Release date and Personal Rating*.
- Have **Redundant** access to your books by having both an offline pdf and a link to an online version hosted on sites such as Google Drive and GM Binder for each book. COMPASS will automatically fallback to another version if the preferred one is unavailable due to a lack of internet for example.
- **Group** your books into collections. Each collection has their own list of tags, authors, ect. and helps you keep an overview by reducing the amount of books that are on your screen at once.
